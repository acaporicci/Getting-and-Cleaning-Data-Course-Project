# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is the final project from the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data by John Hopkins. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Dataset
The data set used for this project is *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones* available online.
The script includes a section to download the files.

## Files
CodeBook.md a code book with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

## Script
run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
